# ExamplePresentation

This is an example of a slide presentation I created for my Data Analysis course project. The project required us to describe the data we used and make two analysis on different variables. One of the analysis must include a group comparison.

My project looked at the Freedom House database and mainly focused on freedom of expression and civil liberty scores, as well as its effects on the total score for the nations. I cleaned data through filtering and thus got the five major nations as my target observations. Patchwork was used to create patched graphs. Xaringan slides template was used to create the slide deck in R markdown.

Files for the project:

-`Presentation-2.html` Final product of the slide deck
-`Presentation 2.Rmd` Code script for reproducing the slides
-`freedomhouse.xlsx` Original dataset for reproduction
